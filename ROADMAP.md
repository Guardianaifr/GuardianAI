# GuardianAI Roadmap

Vision: expand from an LLM firewall into broader AI infrastructure security.

## Next Milestone: Universal Auth Proxy

1. Generic Auth Proxy Mode
- Add pass-through auth enforcement for any HTTP AI service.
- Use case: protect tools that do not ship with strong auth by default.

2. SSH Tunnel Manager
- Add built-in tunnel management for remote GPU and AI services.
- Goal: reduce manual command complexity and setup mistakes.

## Following Milestone: Advanced Threat Detection

3. Adversarial Training
- Continuously update jailbreak detection vectors.

4. Custom NER Models
- Add domain-specific PII detection profiles.

5. Hash-Based Process Blocking
- Validate process signatures by hash instead of name only.

## Following Milestone: Team Controls

6. Role-based permissions
- Add role-scoped access policies.

7. JWT authentication
- Add expiring, verifiable tokens.

8. External log integrations
- Forward events to external monitoring stacks.
